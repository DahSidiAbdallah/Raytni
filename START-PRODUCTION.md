# 🚀 Production Start Commands

Your Raytni project now includes several ways to start the application in production mode:

## 🎯 Main Production Commands

### `npm start` (Recommended)
- Builds the project for production
- Starts the server on port 3000
- Accessible from any network interface (0.0.0.0)
- **Usage**: `npm start`
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000

### `npm run production`
- Alias for `npm start`
- Same functionality as above
- **Usage**: `npm run production`

## 🔧 Alternative Start Commands

### `npm run start:quick`
- Serves the existing build without rebuilding
- Use when you already have a recent build
- **Usage**: `npm run start:quick`
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000

### `npm run serve:local`
- Serves only on localhost (more secure)
- **Usage**: `npm run serve:local`
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000

### `npm run serve:simple`
- Uses a simple Node.js server (fallback option)
- **Usage**: `npm run serve:simple`
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000

## 📝 Development vs Production

```bash
# Development (hot reload, debugging)
npm run dev          # or npm run start:dev

# Production (optimized, minified)
npm start           # Builds and starts production server
npm run production  # Same as above
```

## 🌐 Network Access

When using `npm start` or `npm run serve`, your application will be accessible from:
- **Local**: http://localhost:3000
- **Network**: http://[your-ip-address]:3000

For local-only access, use `npm run serve:local`

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **First time or after changes**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **If build is already up to date**:
   ```bash
   npm run start:quick
   ```

3. **For development**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📊 What happens when you run `npm start`:

1. ✅ Builds the project (`npm run build:prod`)
2. ✅ Optimizes and minifies code
3. ✅ Generates production-ready bundles
4. ✅ Starts preview server on port 3000
5. ✅ Makes app accessible on network
